# Shadow-Hunter-The-Misty-Woods
A horror jumpscare game where you explore the woods in search of an exit. A mysterious entity patrols the woods and will track you down.

Launch the game by opening "Shadow Hunter - The Misty Woods.exe". This project has more user friendly features including controls displayed in game. Just in case, use the mouse to select menu options, ESC to pause/open the menu to view controls, WASD to move, E to interact, Left-Shift to sprint, and Left-Ctrl to sneak.

This project featured VR integration with a library provided by Deakin University. Though the code is present, instructions on how to activate it are not given. A app would need to be downloaded and a pass code shared in order for that to work. The gameplay feature it enabled was allowing you to connect your phone/mobile, and use it like a hand held torch, allowing you to pivot the in game torch by tilting your device.
